This is a work-in-progress of a jEdit syntax highlighing file.

Installation:
Linux: 
find you 'modes' folder, typically ~/.jedit/modes
Save the cuda.xml in your 'modes'
add the following line to modes/catalog:
<MODE NAME="cuda"               FILE="cuda.xml"
                                FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.cu" />





This file is based off of the original cplusplus.xml of jEdit and 
the c_CUDA_2.1.xml originally autored by Splendido(http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=93459)
