This is a work-in-progress of a jEdit syntax highlighing file.

Installation under Linux: 

find your 'modes' folder, typically ~/.jedit/modes
Save the cuda.xml in your 'modes'
add the following line to modes/catalog:
<MODE NAME="cuda"               FILE="cuda.xml"
                                FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.cu" />

Note: may need to "chmod 777 cuda.xml" and select the cuda highlighting under buffer properties. Some combination of those two makes it work. 
Let me know if you have questions. 

Windows/Mac is probably similar.. but I havnt tested that



This file is based off of the original cplusplus.xml of jEdit and
